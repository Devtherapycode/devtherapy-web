### Add a Shop Page to the Devtherapy Podcast Website

You are continuing the website build for **Devtherapy**, a developer-focused podcast brand.
A new **Shop page** needs to be added alongside the current landing page.

### 🧠 Brand Consistency

- Use the existing **mint green (#3CE6B0)**, dark background aesthetic, and minimalist design style.
- Keep the visual tone consistent with the binary/matrix-inspired elements.
- Maintain the same typography and spacing system used on the landing page.

### 🛍️ Shop Page Overview

This page should feel like a natural extension of the Devtherapy brand — built for devs, minimal, intuitive, and clean.

#### 🧩 Layout Sections:

1.  **Hero / Intro Section**

    - Title: "Support the Podcast"
    - Subtitle: "Grab some merch, rep the dev life."
    - Simple banner or featured product visual.

2.  **Product Grid**

    - Clean, responsive grid layout for product cards.
    - Each card includes:

      - Product Image
      - Name
      - Price
      - Button: “View” or “Add to Cart” (choose based on simplicity)

    - Hover effects: light glow or scale animation using brand mint green.

3.  **Product Detail Modal or Page (optional if simplified)**

    - Enlarged view with more info.
    - Size selector (if apparel), quantity, and add to cart.

4.  **Cart Icon in Header (Global)**

    - Simple cart icon visible site-wide.
    - Indicator for number of items (badge).

5.  **Checkout / Purchase Flow (Placeholder UI)**

    - Light mockup or placeholder for purchase – no need for real payment integration.
    - Button: “Complete Order”
    - Message: “Coming soon – real dev gear, real soon.”

6.  **Footer Section**

    - Reinforce the podcast: “All merch supports more dev therapy.”
    - CTA to listen to the latest episode or subscribe.

### 📌 UI Tone

- Developer-first, no-nonsense, subtle geeky cues.
- Avoid anything flashy or overly commercial.
- Smart use of spacing, grid, and typography.

### 📦 Deliverables

- Only generate the visual + layout structure for this new **/shop** page.
- Do **not** modify the existing landing page.
- Output the layout in structured format, based on previous branding decisions.
