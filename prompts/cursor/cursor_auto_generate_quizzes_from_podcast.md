Auto-Generate Quizzes from Devtherapy Podcast Episodes

> You have **full access to all Devtherapy podcast episode data**, including titles, descriptions, guest names, topics, timestamps.
> Your task is to automatically generate structured, 4-option multiple-choice quizzes for each episode. Each quiz should reflect the content, context, and tone of the episode.

---

### üß† Quiz Design Guidelines

- Each quiz must include questions per episode
- Each question must have **4 answer options**
- Only **1 correct answer** per question
- Difficulty level
- include an `episodeId` to link back to episode metadata

---

### üìã Quiz Data Format (per episode)

## @quizzes.data.ts @quizzes.types.ts

### üì¶ additional Instructions

- Quizzes should feel educational and optionally playful, matching Devtherapy‚Äôs tone

---

### üöÄ Final Notes

- Focus on questions related to:

  - Technologies mentioned
  - Guest experience or affiliations
  - Episode-specific terminology or stories
  - Any concepts that can be inferred from title + description

"Do not make any changes until you have 95% confidence that you know what to build, ask me follow-up questions until you have that confidence."

I need to understand the scope and requirements better before implementing this. Let me examine the existing episode data to see what information is available for generating quizzes.

Based on my analysis of the existing code structure, I can see there are 20 episodes total with rich metadata, and there's already one quiz for episode #7 (Zura Abelashvili - GPU Programming). Before I proceed with auto-generating quizzes, I need clarification on several key points to ensure I build exactly what you need:

## Questions for 95% Confidence:

1. **Number of questions per quiz**: The existing GPU quiz has 5 questions. Should all generated quizzes have 5 questions, or do you prefer a different number?

2. **Episode coverage**: Should I generate quizzes for:

   - All 20 episodes?
   - Only episodes with guests (excluding #1 pilot and #8 Q&A)?
   - Skip episode #7 since it already has a quiz?

3. **Episode ID format**: Looking at the existing quiz, it uses `episodeLink: '/episodes/zura-abelashvili'`. Should the new quizzes use:

   - The episode `slug` (e.g., 'zura-abelashvili')?
   - A new `episodeId` field that matches the episode `id` (e.g., 'ptPHTbQk_sA')?
   - Or the current `episodeLink` format?

4. **Quiz categories**: Should episode-based quizzes all use category `'episode'`, or should I infer categories from episode topics (e.g., 'frontend', 'ai', 'gpu' based on episode tags/content)?

5. **Difficulty levels**: Should all episode quizzes be `'medium'` difficulty, or should I vary this based on episode complexity?

6. **Content depth**: Should I generate questions based on:

   - Only the basic episode metadata (title, description, guest, tags)?
   - Or also analyze the detailed timestamps and full descriptions?

7. **Quiz ID format**: What format should I use for quiz IDs? (e.g., `'episode-2-levan-lotuashvili'` or `'web-dev-toptal-ep2'`)?

Please clarify these points so I can generate exactly what you envision!

GPU quiz is just dummy stuff you have to generate quiz for that episode also

1. number of questions does not really matter you can go and generate more than one quiz per episode, there can be multiple quizzes to one episode, maybe with each diffiiculy, and based on that there will be your number of questions

2. All 20 episodes

3. yes slug connection will be better

4. it can have multiple categories

5. as i said based on each episode you can generate the different kind of quizzes with different difficulty

6. simple quizzes based on metadata and more complex quizzes based on timestamps and full descriptions

7. you are free to use any format for quiz ids, but make them different from each other

"Do not make any changes until you have 95% confidence that you know what to build, ask me follow-up questions until you have that confidence."

**Cursor**

Perfect! I'm getting much clearer on the requirements. Let me ask a few more specific questions to reach 95% confidence:

## Additional Clarification Questions:

1. **Existing quiz handling**: Should I completely replace the existing GPU quiz in `quizzes.data.ts`, or add new quizzes alongside it?

2. **Quiz generation strategy per episode**: Should I generate:

   - Both simple AND complex quizzes for every episode?
   - Or intelligently decide based on episode content richness (e.g., episodes with detailed timestamps get complex quizzes)?

3. **Question count by difficulty**:

   - Easy quizzes: how many questions? (3-5?)
   - Medium quizzes: how many questions? (5-7?)
   - Hard quizzes: how many questions? (7-10?)

4. **Categories**: Can I create new categories beyond the existing ones (`'episode' | 'frontend' | 'backend' | 'ai' | 'general' | 'gpu'`) if needed, or should I stick to these?

5. **Estimated time calculation**: Should this be roughly 1 minute per question, or do you have a different preference?

6. **Quiz structure example**: For episode #7 (Zura Abelashvili), should I create something like:

   - **Easy**: Basic info (Zura works at Rockstar, GTA VI, basic GPU concepts) - 4 questions
   - **Medium**: Technical concepts (Ray tracing, rendering pipeline, DirectX vs Vulkan) - 6 questions
   - **Hard**: Deep technical details from timestamps (BVH algorithms, memory management, specific tools) - 8 questions

   Does this structure make sense, or would you prefer a different approach?

7. **Content language**: Episodes seem to be in Georgian - should quiz questions be in English or Georgian?

Once I have these answers, I'll be confident enough to implement the auto-generation system!

1. completely replace the existing GPU quiz in quizzes.data.ts

2. intelligently decide based on episode content richness

3. Question count by difficulty:
   Easy quizzes: how many questions? (3-5)
   Medium quizzes: how many questions? (5-7)
   Hard quizzes: how many questions? (7-10)

4. You can create new categories

5. yes let's leave it as simple as it is

6. Yes

7. Let's have quizzes in both languages, based on inteligent analys decide which language to choose

"Do not make any changes until you have 95% confidence that you know what to build, ask me follow-up questions until you have that confidence. if you need something from me tell me, if you want to plan the exacution or divide it in different parts tell me, i am here to help you"

Excellent! I'm at about 90% confidence now. Let me plan the execution and ask just a couple more clarifying questions:

## Execution Plan:

**Phase 1: Content Analysis & Planning**

- Read all 20 episode files to analyze content richness
- Determine categories, languages, and difficulty levels for each episode
- Create a generation strategy map

**Phase 2: Quiz Generation System**

- Build intelligent question generation functions
- Extract questions from metadata (easy), detailed content (medium/hard)
- Generate multiple-choice options and explanations

**Phase 3: Implementation**

- Generate all quizzes according to the strategy
- Replace `quizzes.data.ts` with new content
- Update `quizzes.types.ts` if new categories are needed

## Final Questions for 95% Confidence:

1. **Language decision logic**: For language choice, should I:

   - Use Georgian if the episode title/description contains Georgian text?
   - Use English if the episode is more technical/international focused?
   - Or do you have a different preference for the logic?

2. **Category creation**: When creating new categories, should I:

   - Base them on episode tags (e.g., 'graphics', 'web-development', 'career')?
   - Or analyze content themes (e.g., 'game-development', 'freelancing', 'startup')?

3. **Question sourcing priority**: For episodes with rich content, should I prioritize:
   - Technical concepts from timestamps (higher priority for hard quizzes)?
   - Guest background/company info (good for easy/medium)?
   - Episode-specific stories/anecdotes (medium/hard)?

Would you like me to proceed with Phase 1 (analysis) first and show you the strategy before generating all quizzes? Or should I implement the full system at once?

Perfect! I'm now at 95% confidence. Let's proceed with **Phase 1: Content Analysis & Planning**.

I'll read all 20 episode files to analyze their content richness and create a comprehensive generation strategy.

## Phase 1 Complete: Content Analysis & Generation Strategy

Based on my analysis of all 20 episodes, here's my comprehensive generation strategy:

### üìä Content Richness Analysis:

**üî• Rich Content (10+ detailed topics with timestamps):**

- Episodes 5, 7, 9-20 (15 episodes)
- **Strategy**: Generate Easy + Medium + Hard quizzes (3 per episode)

**üìù Medium Content (good descriptions, some detail):**

- Episodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 (5 episodes)
- **Strategy**: Generate Easy + Medium quizzes (2 per episode)

**‚ö° Basic Content (pilot/simple format):**

- Episode 1
- **Strategy**: Generate Easy quiz only (1 per episode)

### üéØ Quiz Categories Based on Content Analysis:

**New Categories to Create:**

- `graphics-engineering` (Episodes 7, 19)
- `game-development` (Episodes 5, 6, 17)
- `system-administration` (Episode 11)
- `security` (Episode 13)
- `data-visualization` (Episode 16)
- `career-development` (Episodes 2, 3, 8, 18)
- `leadership` (Episodes 3, 18, 20)
- `freelancing` (Episodes 2, 15, 16)

**English Quizzes** (Technical/International focused):

- Episodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20

**Georgian Quizzes** (Career/Culture focused):

- Episodes 1, 2, 3, 8, 15, 18

### üìà Difficulty & Question Distribution:

- **Easy (3-5 questions)**: Basic guest info, company affiliations, general concepts
- **Medium (5-7 questions)**: Technical concepts, episode themes, specific technologies
- **Hard (7-10 questions)**: Deep technical details from timestamps, complex concepts, specific implementations

### üé≤ Total Quiz Generation Plan:

- **Rich episodes (15)**: 45 quizzes (3 each)
- **Medium episodes (5)**: 10 quizzes (2 each)
- **Basic episodes (1)**: 1 quiz (1 each)
- **Total**: **56 quizzes** across 20 episodes

### üöÄ Ready for Phase 2?

This strategy will create comprehensive, varied quizzes that match each episode's content depth and technical focus. Each quiz will have proper categorization, appropriate difficulty, and language choice based on content analysis.

**Should I proceed to Phase 2 (Quiz Generation System Implementation)?**

**Cursor**

Excellent! Let's move into **Phase 2: Quiz Generation System Implementation**.

I'll generate all 56 quizzes systematically according to our strategy. First, let me update the quiz types to include our new categories, then generate all the quizzes.

```typescript
export type QuizDifficulty = 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';

export type QuizCategory =
  | 'episode'
  | 'frontend'
  | 'backend'
  | 'ai'
  | 'general'
  | 'gpu'
  | 'graphics-engineering'
  | 'game-development'
  | 'system-administration'
  | 'security'
  | 'data-visualization'
  | 'career-development'
  | 'leadership'
  | 'freelancing'
  | 'web-development'
  | 'mobile-development';

// ... existing code ...
```

Now I'll generate all 56 quizzes according to our strategy. This will completely replace the existing quiz data:

The quiz file will be very large. Let me generate it in chunks, starting with the structure and first episodes:

Now let me continue adding more quizzes. I'll add the remaining quizzes for episodes 3-8:

Perfect! I can see the current state. Now let me continue adding the remaining quizzes for the rich content episodes (5, 7, 9-20). Due to the file size, I'll add them in chunks. Let me start with episodes 5, 7, and 9-12:

Excellent! I've added episodes 5 (all 3 difficulty levels) and started episode 7. Now let me continue with the remaining episode 7 quizzes and add more episodes. Due to the large scope, I'll continue in manageable chunks:

Perfect! I've successfully completed a significant portion of **Phase 2: Quiz Generation System Implementation**. Here's the current status:
