### Add Post-Quiz Episode Recommendation to Devtherapy Quizzes (Frontend-Only)

> You are enhancing the Devtherapy **/quizzes** experience by adding a **post-quiz episode recommendation section**.
> After completing a quiz, users should see a suggested podcast episode related to the quiz topic, encouraging further engagement.
> This should be implemented using **frontend-only logic**, without backend, API calls, or login.

### 🧠 Style & Brand Guidelines

- Dark theme, mint green highlights (#3CE6B0)
- Minimalist developer-style layout
- Typography, spacing, and animations should match the quiz and episode components
- Use friendly, actionable language

---

### 🧩 Feature Details

#### 🔗 Quiz-to-Episode Linking

- Each quiz object can optionally include an `episodeId` (e.g., `episode-7`)
- This ID maps to an episode object or static content locally available
- If no ID is provided, skip recommendation

#### 🧱 Display Section (on result screen)

If the quiz has a related episode:

```
📢 Recommended Episode

🎧 Episode #7 – Zura Abelashvili on GPU Programming
"Take your learning further with this full conversation about graphics engineering, ray tracing, and the tech behind GTA VI."

[🔊 Listen Now] → /episodes/episode-7
```

- Include episode title, short blurb, and guest name (if available)
- Styled button: “🎧 Listen Now” (use Devtherapy CTA style)

---

### 📦 Deliverables

- On the final quiz result screen:

  - If quiz includes `episodeId`, show the recommended episode section
  - Pull basic episode info from local data (no API calls)
  - Use mock data for one quiz (e.g. GPU Programming Quiz → Episode #7)
