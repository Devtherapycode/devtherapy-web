### Build a “Quizzes” Page for Devtherapy with Frontend-Only Interactive Quizzes

> You are building a dedicated **/quizzes** page on the Devtherapy website.
> This page allows users to take short, fun, and educational quizzes related to podcast episodes and developer topics — all running on the frontend with no backend or login required.

---

### 🧠 Brand & Style Guidelines

- Design should match Devtherapy’s dark theme with mint green (#3CE6B0) accents
- Use developer-inspired UI: terminal-style buttons, glowing states, or retro game elements
- UX should be intuitive and mobile-friendly
- Fun but focused tone — educational, not gimmicky

---

### 🧩 Page Structure: `/quizzes`

#### 1. **Intro Section**

- Title: “Dev Quizzes 🧠”
- Subtitle: “Test your dev skills, episode knowledge, or just have fun.”
- Optional tag filter: `All`, `Frontend`, `AI`, `Episode 7`, etc.

---

#### 2. **Quiz Card Grid**

- Show multiple quizzes as cards
- Each card includes:

  - Title (e.g., “GTA VI GPU Quiz”)
  - Short description
  - Tag (e.g., “Based on Episode #7”)
  - Button: “Take Quiz”

---

#### 3. **Quiz Page Modal or Route**

When a user clicks on a quiz, open an interactive quiz interface.

---

### ✅ Quiz Logic & Format

- Format: 1 question at a time
- 4 answer options
- Show whether the answer is correct or not instantly
- Progress indicator (e.g., “2/5 questions completed”)
- Final screen: “You got X/5!” + option to retry

---

### 🧪 Example Dummy Quiz (Episode-Linked)

> **Quiz Title:** GPU Programming Basics (Based on Episode #7)
> **Questions:**

```ts
{
  id: 'gpu-quiz-ep7',
  title: 'GPU Programming Basics',
  episodeLink: '/episodes/episode-7',
  questions: [
    {
      question: 'What does GPU stand for?',
      options: ['General Processing Unit', 'Graphics Programming Utility', 'Graphics Processing Unit', 'Geometric Processing Unit'],
      correctAnswerIndex: 2
    },
    {
      question: 'Which company does Zura work for?',
      options: ['Ubisoft', 'Rockstar Games', 'Valve', 'Epic Games'],
      correctAnswerIndex: 1
    }
    // Add more as needed
  ]
}
```

- Logic should run entirely on frontend using local state
- Track score in session (optional: `localStorage`)

---

### 📦 Deliverables

- Build quiz runner UI with:

  - Question-by-question flow
