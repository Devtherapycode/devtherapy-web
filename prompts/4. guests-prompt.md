### Build a Guest Profiles Page for Devtherapy

> You are continuing development for the Devtherapy podcast website.
> Add a new page: **/guests** — a curated, on-brand directory of podcast guests with individual profile pages.

---

### 🧠 Brand & Style Guidelines

- Maintain existing Devtherapy style: dark theme, mint green (#3CE6B0) highlights, clean developer aesthetics.
- Font, spacing, and hover animation style should match the landing/shop/episodes pages.
- Use illustrated avatars or real guest images based on what's provided.

### 🔍 Guests Directory Page (/guests)

#### 1. **Intro Section**

- Title: “Meet the Minds Behind the Mic”
- Subtitle: “A growing list of engineers, creators, and thinkers who’ve joined us on Devtherapy.”

#### 2. **Guest Cards Grid**

- For each guest:

  - Image/avatar
  - Full name
  - One-liner bio or notable affiliation (e.g. “Rockstar Games, GTA VI”)
  - Link to episode(s)
  - Button: “View Profile”

- Responsive and searchable (optional)

### 🧑‍💻 Guest Detail Page (/guests/zura-abelashvili)

#### Hero Section

- Large image/avatar of the guest
- Name: **Zura Abelashvili**
- Title/Role: **Graphics Engineer at Rockstar Games**
- Tagline: “Episode #7 – From Georgia to GTA VI”

#### About Section

- Short bio, highlight from the episode
- Include quote or insight from the episode

#### Embedded Episode

  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptPHTbQk_sA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptPHTbQk_sA)
- Use a styled video embed that matches the site theme

#### Related Content (Optional)

- Show other guests from the same industry or similar episodes

### 📦 Deliverables

- Layout and structure for both the **guests directory** and a **guest detail page**.
- Only mock or use Zura Abelashvili’s data as an example guest for now.
- No implementation code or backend — design and structure only.
