Build a “Dev Wrapped” Year-in-Review Page Using Local Listening Data (No Backend)

> You are adding a personalized, data-driven experience to the Devtherapy website.
> Build a **“Dev Wrapped” year-in-review page** that summarizes a user's podcast listening behavior, based entirely on data stored in their browser (`localStorage`).

---

### 🎯 Goal

Create a visually engaging, developer-themed page that reflects the user's year with Devtherapy — highlighting their listening habits, favorite topics, and fun personalized stats.

---

### 🧠 UX & Brand Guidelines

- Theme: **Dark mode**, mint green highlights, developer-console-inspired layout
- Tone: Friendly, data-driven, a little playful
- Use Devtherapy font, spacing, animations — make it feel like a reward screen in VS Code

---

### 🧩 Feature Sections on `/wrapped`

#### 1. **Hero Title**

> “Here’s what your year looked like in Devtherapy.”

- Mint green animated title
- Subheadline: “You debugged. You listened. You thrived.”

---

#### 2. **Top Stats (from localStorage)**

Pull from locally stored listening data:

- Episodes completed: `X`
- Total time listened (estimate): `Y hours`
- Most-listened guest: `Z`
- Most-used tag/topic (if available)

---

#### 3. **Favorite Episode**

- Based on time spent or user marking as favorite
- Show title, thumbnail, CTA to replay it

---

#### 4. **Fun Facts**

Generate dynamic “achievements” like:

- 🧠 “You listened to 3 hours in a single night. Respect.”
- 🎧 “You completed 5 episodes about GPU programming.”

---

#### 5. **"Next Year Goals"**

- CTA to add episodes to their Listen Later queue
- Example:

  > “Start your 2025 with Episode #9 — Devs, Burnout, and Balance.”

---

#### 6. **Share Button (Optional)**

- “Share your Dev Wrapped”
- Copy summary stats to clipboard
- Optional: generate image/card for social (future phase)

---

### 🔧 Technical Notes

- No backend or API
- All user data pulled from `localStorage` used by the Listening Tracker feature
- Use fallback messages if user has no data (e.g., “Start your Devtherapy journey now.”)

---

### 📦 Deliverables

- Create a `/wrapped` route
- Visually styled summary page with sections outlined above
- Pull data from `localStorage` used by the Listen Later and Listening Tracker system
- Use animations and styling to make it feel like a celebration
