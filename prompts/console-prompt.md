### Add Developer-Focused Easter Egg Console Messages to the Devtherapy Website

> You are enhancing the Devtherapy website with subtle, developer-only touches.
> Add **console.log-based Easter eggs** that appear when someone opens the browser dev tools.

### 🧠 Brand Style & Voice

- Devtherapy is for developers, by developers.
- Tone should be **clever**, **casual**, and optionally **philosophical or ironic**, like inside jokes from the dev world.
- Messages should reflect the vibe of the podcast — real talk, dry humor, and smart culture.

### 💡 Console Message Structure

#### 1. **Welcome / Easter Egg Header**

```js
console.log('%cWelcome to Devtherapy.', 'color: #3CE6B0; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;');
```

#### 2. **Hidden Message or Joke**

```js
console.log('You found the secret console. Now fix that one bug haunting your dreams.');
```

#### 3. **Episode Recommendation**

```js
console.log('🔥 Recommended Episode: #7 with Zura Abelashvili – GPUs, GTA VI, and Ray Tracing.');
```

#### 4. **Recruiting Vibe or CTA**

```js
console.log('Psst... ever thought about being on the show? DM us on X (@devtherapy_io)');
```

#### 5. **Random Debug Quote (Optional Rotation)**

```js
console.log('“99 little bugs in the code, 99 bugs in the code...” 🎵');
```

### 📦 Deliverables

- Design a small set of 3–5 styled console messages.
- Randomize or rotate if possible (not required).
- Do **not** affect site functionality — keep it passive and purely for devs opening DevTools.
- Keep tone consistent with Devtherapy branding and humor.
